I prompted Claude AI for the code. The canvas size is 200x200 because 240x240 is too much for this PSRAM lacking board. Tools: Pen, Eraser, Fill, Spray, Line, Rectangle, Ellipse, Eyedropper. You can change the brush sizes and save custom colors to the right side slots. Imports/exports BMP images off SD card. No undo button, so you gotta save often. Any comments, questions, or suggestions, feel free. 

Edit: Mirror mode added!

Edit 2: 2D Animation added!

Edit 3: Zoom function! Less jitter! Better save/load menus!

Edit 4: More zoom! Up to 8x! Adjusted some animation features.

Edit 5: Undo/redo buttons added
